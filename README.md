# Stellar_Classification
An exploration of a set 100,000 observations of stars, galaxies, and quasars done by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey

# Key 
* obj_ID = Object Identifier, the unique value that identifies the object in the image catalog used by the CAS
* alpha = Right Ascension angle (at J2000 epoch)
* delta = Declination angle (at J2000 epoch)
* u = Ultraviolet filter in the photometric system
* g = Green filter in the photometric system
* r = Red filter in the photometric system
* i = Near Infrared filter in the photometric system
* z = Infrared filter in the photometric system
* run_ID = Run Number used to identify the specific scan
* rereun_ID = Rerun Number to specify how the image was processed
* cam_col = Camera column to identify the scanline within the run
* field_ID = Field number to identify each field
* spec_obj_ID = Unique ID used for optical spectroscopic objects (this means that 2 different observations with the same spec_obj_ID must share the output class)
* class = object class (galaxy, star or quasar object)
* redshift = redshift value based on the increase in wavelength
* plate = plate ID, identifies each plate in SDSS
* MJD = Modified Julian Date, used to indicate when a given piece of SDSS data was taken
* fiber_ID = fiber ID that identifies the fiber that pointed the light at the focal plane in each observation
